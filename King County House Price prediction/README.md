## ABSTRACT 
This project aims to determine and predict selling price of a house in King County based on various predictor determinants such as year of its building, square feet are of various segments in the house, number of various types of rooms etc. . We consider these parameters independent of each other as an assumption and later predict selling price using Regression models. These Classification and Regression models include Random Forest,XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting method, Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression with normalization. Identifying and disparaging accuracy and logloss are means to decipher which algorithms are better than other. Additionally tuning hyperparameters to their best values generate models that are better fit the linear model and predict output with data of out of sample values with better accuracy. These Hyperparameters are also analysed for various other values to obtain their relationship with outcome.It is resultant of these computations that model fits to a satisfactory accuracy
